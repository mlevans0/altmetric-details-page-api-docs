Welcome to Altmetric's Details Page API documentation!
======================================================
 
With technical expertise, you can create your own ways of slicing and viewing our data, which gives you the freedom to complete more complex research, ask more granular questions of our data, 
and build custom visualisations. The major advantage is that API calls allow for programmatic, automated data flows, so that the data can be called into your own system, and remain current.

**The Details Page API** focuses on a subset of the data we have about research outputs and mentions. It is a very powerful tool if you have the skills and resources needed to use it. 
The Details Page API allows you to find out everything you need to know about an individual DOI or Journal ID. This API works best when you have a list of output identifiers for
which you want either the count of mentions ('count') or the full text of mentions ('full access').
