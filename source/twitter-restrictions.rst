Twitter restrictions
====================
Due to a contractual agreement that Altmetric has with Twitter, a maximum of 1,500,000 tweet IDs can be retrieved in any rolling 30 day period, if your request returns tweet IDs, please check the X-TweetIDRateLimit-Limit and X-TweetIDRateLimit-Remaining headers to check how close you are to the limit.

.. note::
    Please ensure that you are compliant with Twitter's `Terms of Service <https://twitter.com/en/tos>`_ and the `Developer Policy <https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/policy.html>`_ when using Twitter data.
